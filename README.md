# Jira-Clone

Task management app that give you a visual overview of what being worked on by splitting every project to boards every board have tasks and every task have description and multiple to-do Lists, the user can add members to project â€¦ I did use Laravel as back-end to serve my Rest-API, VueJS in front-end, VueX for state management, Pusher for Real time communication and JWT for Authorization.
Inspired by Jira from Atlassian
Technology used: Laravel / JS / HTML / Axios / MySQL / Vue.JS /VueX / Vue Router / Tailwind CSS / Vuetify / JWT / Pusher / Laravel-Echo
